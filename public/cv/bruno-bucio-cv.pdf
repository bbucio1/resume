SUMMARY
Business Management and Finance student at Universidad Panamericana with experience in corporate finance, financial modeling, client relationship management, and strategic sales. I have worked at a private debt fund supporting the structuring of deals, preparing investor-ready presentations, and participating in meetings with company owners and key stakeholders. Additionally, I have led the development of a new digital business line, managed cross-functional teams, and executed pricing strategies based on market analysis. I bring a combination of analytical rigor, commercial awareness, and execution focus, and I am eager to contribute to fast-paced, high-performance environments.
