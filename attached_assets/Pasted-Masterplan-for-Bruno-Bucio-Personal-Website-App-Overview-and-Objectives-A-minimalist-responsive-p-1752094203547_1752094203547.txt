App Overview and Objectives

A minimalist, responsive personal website for Bruno Bucio Chávez aimed at showcasing his background to potential employers. The site will include his academic and professional experience, skills, contact details, and a downloadable CV.

Target Audience
	•	Potential employers in finance, business management, and related fields.

Core Features and Functionality
	•	Home/Introduction section with name, title, and photo placeholder
	•	About Me section summarizing Bruno’s professional background
	•	Education section listing institutions, degrees, and relevant programs
	•	Experience section outlining key roles and achievements

High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations

	•	Framework (optional): Astro, Hugo, or Next.js (with static export)
	•	Hosting: GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel
	•	Assets: Placeholder image for profile, CV PDF hosted with the site files

Conceptual Data Model

As a static site, no dynamic data model is needed. Content is structured as follows:
	•	profile: name, intro text, image URL
	•	education[]: school, degree, duration, highlights
	•	experience[]: role, company, duration, accomplishments
	•	skills: technical, language, soft skills
	•	contact: email, phone, LinkedIn, website URL

User Interface Design Principles
	•	Clean, minimalist layout with responsive design
	•	Sans-serif fonts for readability (e.g., Inter, Roboto, or Helvetica)
	•	Simple navigation, likely a sticky top bar with section anchors
	•	Soft neutral color palette (e.g., white, gray, navy accents)
	•	Clear CTAs for viewing contact info and downloading CV

Security Considerations
	•	No contact form; only displays contact info
	•	No user input, so no risk of injection or spam
	•	Use HTTPS hosting for secure connection

Development Phases or Milestones
	1.	Planning & Design: Outline content and wireframes (if desired)
	2.	Development: Build the static site structure and layout
	3.	Testing: Ensure mobile responsiveness and browser compatibility
	4.	Deployment: Host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel
	5.	Final Touches: Upload real photo and CV when available

Potential Challenges and Solutions
	•	CV file hosting: Ensure PDF is included in repo or hosted securely
	•	Mobile layout: Test across devices to ensure consistency
	•	Placeholder management: Clearly label sections to update later

Future Expansion Possibilities
	•	Add projects or blog section
	•	Include testimonials or recommendations
	•	Integrate a contact form if backend added later
	•	Support multiple languages if needed
